# Epic-Games-external-drive-game-repair

Solution to epic games not finding games on external drives after they are disconnected and connected again.
This can be also used for easier moving of your games.

# how to use
- download batch file to your computer, ideally into the folder where your games are stored (but it shouldn't make any difference if you dont do so)
- dont open the file directly, drag the folder of game you want to repair onto this file (open with epic_games_external_drive_game_repair)
- program will ask you to open epic games and start download of the game you're trying to repair into the directory it was in
- after download starts, program will terminate epic games
- next you need to again open epicgames and resume download, epicgames should verify the files and almost imediately install the game
- Enjoy :)
